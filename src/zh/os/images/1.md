# install ventoy
> Ventoy is an open-source tool for creating bootable USB drives, and its main function is to assist us in installing the system. Advantages: The software is compact, with a Windows version of less than 15MB and a Linux version of 18MB, which is much smaller than the traditional WINPE with hundreds of MB. Compared to traditional PE, deployment is faster,. Installing the system is simple and effortless. Copy the Windows or Linux image directly to the USB drive in advance, and then boot from the USB drive to provide you with a selectable system list option. Click on which system you want to install.
